# Project Description
GOAL
Our goal was to visualize data regarding the locations of pickleball courts, hopsitals, and the elderly population in the state of Florida to understand the relationships of these categories and explain how their proximity to each other could help explain trends in increases in the number of elderly people in Florida as well as the increased popularity of pickleball. This was our group's first opportunity to build from scratch and practice more of the development skills. 

CREDITS 
Each member of our group referenced activities that we had completed in class and challenges that we had completed outside of class in order to understand the syntax and structure of the different files that were created to complete this project. When stuck, members of our group would ask questions to Chatgpt in order to clarify what might be causing an error or how to move a section of code to a different line in order for it to run correctly. Additionally we met via Zoom regularly to solve problems and overcome challenges by having everyone look at code segments together to identify why it may not be functioning as we expected to and to make changes.

Our group completed a project focused on the relationship between pickleball courts and where older people move to retire, focusing exclusively on the state of Florida as our retirement location. Relationships of interest included:  elderly populations and proximity to pickleball courts and where is the elderly population on the rise within the US and where is it decreasing.Data was gathered primarily from Census.gov data tables  to accurately identify populations of the different counties in Florida and an API from The Global Pickleball Network website to collect data focused on pickleball court locations.
