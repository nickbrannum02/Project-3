        <h2>Fun Facts About Pickleball and Florida's Elderly Population</h2>
        <p>
            1. Pickleball was first invented in 1965 by Joel Pritchard and Bill Bell when they came home and was bored with nothing to do.
               There was an old badminton court so the two looked for some badminton equipment but couldn't find a full set of rackets. 
               They improvised and started playing with ping-pong paddles and a perforated plastic ball.<br> 
            <br> 2. Pickleball players are called "Picklers" and when you lose a match you haven't "lost", you have been "pickled"<br>
            <br> 3. Pickleball was named after one of the inventors, Joel Pritchard's, dog Pickles.<br>
            <br> 4. Pickleball is estimated to contribute roughly $400 million in healthcare costs this year, with 86% of ER visits for senior citizens being related to pickleball according to a UBS study.<br>
            <br> 5. 21.3% of Florida's entire population is over the age of 65 years old making it the state with the second highest elderly population by percentage, only being beaten out by Maine's 21.8%.<br>
