        <h2>Fun Facts About Pickleball and Florida's Elderly Population</h2>

        <p>
            1. Pickleball was first invented in 1965 by Joel Pritchard and Bill Bell when they came home and was bored with nothing to do.
               There was an old badminton court so the two looked for some badminton equipment but couldn't find a full set of rackets. 
               They improvised and started playing with ping-pong paddles and a perforated plastic ball.<br> 
            <br> 2. Pickleball players are called "Picklers" and when you lose a match you haven't "lost", you have been "pickled"<br>
            <br> 3. Pickleball was named after one of the inventors, Joel Pritchard's, dog Pickles.<br>
            <br> 4. Pickleball is estimated to contribute roughly $400 million in healthcare costs this year, with 86% of ER visits for senior citizens being related to pickleball according to a UBS study.<br>
            <br> 5. 21.3% of Florida's entire population is over the age of 65 years old making it the state with the second highest elderly population by percentage, only being beaten out by Maine's 21.8%.<br>
            <br> 6. An academic study suggests that "playing pickleball as a form of serious leisure may add significant value to older adults’ daily lives and contribute to successful aging".<br>
            <br> 7. There are currently 10,320 pickleball courts in the United States.<br>
            <br> 8. Players aged 55 and up were the largest age bracket of pickleball players in 2021, comprising 19.8%<br>
            <br> 9. Based on statistics from February 2023,Florida has the 2nd most places to play pickleball with 770 locations.<br>
            <br> 10. Interest in pickleball has increased 467% over the past 5 years as measured by Google Trends, Utah is the state showing the most interest in pickleball currently. <br>

                A pickleball court is the same size as a doubles badminton court at 20 feet wide and 44 feet long. The same court size 
                is used for both double and singles with the net hight set at 36 inches at the sidelines and 34 inches in the middle. 
                The pickleball court is set similar to a tennis court with the left and right service areas and the 7 foot non-volley 
                zone most commonly known as the "kitchen"
                <img src="static/images/PickleballPaddles.png" alt="Pickleball Equipment" style="float: right; height: 200px; width: 200px; margin:40px;">
                <br><br><br><br>
                The equipment used in pickleball are relatively simple. Each player uses a paddle smaller than a tennis raquet but a little bigger than a ping pong paddle.
                Pickleball paddles were originally made only from wood, however, 
                more modern paddles are made primarily from more lightweight materials,
                such as plastic, aluminum, and graphite. The ball that is used in pickleball is made of plastic with many holes in it and depending on if the Picklers are 
                playing on an indoor court or outdoor court, the ball used is slightly different with the indoor ball being lighter with larger holse and being more optimized
                for a smoother court and the outdoor ball being heavier and more durable to withstand rougher surfaces, wind, and the elements
